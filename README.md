Nchantrs is a Python Module built to build PyQt5/PySide2 applications quickly by
using a combination of yaml configuration and python widget files.  These
applications are built over a sqlite backend using the FxSQuiRL Module to read
and write to one or more sqlite database files and manage an inmemory and ondisk
cache
